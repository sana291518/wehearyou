            <h2>Types of Depression</h2>
            <p>
                Depression is not a one-size-fits-all condition. There are different types of depression that can manifest in various ways. Understanding these types can help individuals and their loved ones recognize the symptoms and seek appropriate treatment. Here are some common types of depression:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), also known as clinical depression, is the most common form of depression. It is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed. People with MDD may experience changes in appetite and sleep patterns, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of self-harm or suicide.

                    <p>
                        Treatment for MDD often includes a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective therapies for MDD, helping individuals challenge negative thought patterns and develop coping strategies.

                <li>
                    <h3>Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), also called dysthymia, is a chronic form of depression that lasts for at least two years. Individuals with PDD experience a low mood that is less severe than MDD but more persistent. They may have difficulty experiencing joy and struggle to maintain daily functioning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Psychotherapy is a common treatment for PDD, helping individuals explore underlying issues and develop healthy coping mechanisms. In some cases, medication may also be prescribed to manage symptoms.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs at a specific time of the year, usually during the fall and winter months when there is less sunlight. The lack of sunlight can disrupt the body's internal clock and lead to symptoms of depression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Light therapy, also known as phototherapy, is a common treatment for SAD. It involves exposure to a bright light that mimics natural sunlight. Additionally, counseling and lifestyle changes, such as getting regular exercise and spending time outdoors, can be beneficial for managing SAD.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression, involves extreme mood swings that include periods of mania (elevated mood and energy) and depression. The shifts between these mood states can be severe and disruptive, affecting a person's thoughts, behavior, and ability to function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Treatment for bipolar disorder often includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Mood stabilizers are commonly prescribed to manage mood swings, while therapy helps individuals learn to recognize triggers and develop coping strategies.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Postpartum Depression</h3>
                    <p>
                        Postpartum depression affects some women after giving birth. It involves feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that can interfere with caring for themselves and their newborns. Hormonal changes, lack of sleep, and the demands of motherhood can contribute to the development of postpartum depression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Support from family and healthcare professionals is essential for women with postpartum depression. Counseling, support groups, and, in some cases, medication can be beneficial in managing symptoms and promoting recovery.
