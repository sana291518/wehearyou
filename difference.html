                    Anxiety is a state of uneasiness and apprehension about future uncertainties. It is characterized by excessive worrying, restlessness, and a sense of impending danger or panic.

                <h2>Depression</h2>
                <p>

People with depression may experience changes in appetite and sleep patterns, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of worthlessness. Depression affects daily functioning and can lead to thoughts of self-harm or suicide.

                <h2>Relationship Between Anxiety and Depression</h2>
                <p>
                    Anxiety and depression are closely related and can coexist in an individual. People with anxiety may develop depression if their anxiety remains untreated over an extended period. Chronic anxiety can drain an individual's emotional and physical resources, contributing to the development of depression.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While anxiety is characterized by worry and fear, depression is marked by persistent sadness and a lack of interest in life.</li>
                    <li>Both anxiety and depression can lead to difficulties in sleeping and concentrating.</li>
                    <li>Treatment plans for individuals with comorbid anxiety and depression may involve a combination of therapies to address both conditions.</li>
                    <li>Support from loved ones and mental health professionals is essential in managing and overcoming both anxiety and depression.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Example: An individual with anxiety who experiences significant life changes or prolonged stress may become increasingly withdrawn, lose interest in hobbies, and struggle to get out of bed, indicating the coexistence of depression.
